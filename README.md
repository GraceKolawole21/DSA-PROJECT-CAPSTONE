# Excel Analysis Review on Amazon Product
## Using Dashboard to summarise my analysis and recommendations: 
The bar chart indicates varying average discounts across categories, with some (e.g., Health&  Personal Care) showing higher discounts (around 40%). This suggests targeted discount strategies could boost sales in lower-discount categories.
The pie chart reveals a diverse distribution of product price ranges, with no single bucket dominating. This indicates a balanced portfolio, though high-price items may need more promotion to leverage their revenue potential.
#### Recommendations:
Optimize Discounts: Adjust discount levels in underperforming categories to align with the 0.4-0.5 range, where ratings peak, to maximize customer satisfaction and sales.
Enhance Low-Rated Categories: Invest in quality improvements or marketing for Home & Kitchen to close the rating gap with top performers.
Promote High-Value Items: Leverage the diverse price range by targeting promotions at higher-priced products to capitalize on the substantial revenue potential.
